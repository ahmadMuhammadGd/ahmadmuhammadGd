### Docker
I usually use Docker for a clean and movable learning and development environment. It's like learning to cook without missing out on the kitchen!

### C programming
For low-level programming, fast computing for mathematical equations, and getting closer to this amazing machine.

### Python
I use Python for reusing AI models, automating tasks, web scraping, making Streamlit apps, and building data pipelines.

### MySQL Server
I love open-source tools; that's why I prefer this engine over SQL Server.

### JavaScript
It sounds strange, but did you know that you can automate data flow in Google Sheets using JavaScript in the Apps Script editor?

### Ubuntu
You know, it's open-source again. I could replace Windows with it. I use shell scripting for automating the process of pushing my changes!
